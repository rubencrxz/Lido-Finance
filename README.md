# 💧 Lido Finance CSM V2

Lido Community Staking Module v2 (CSM v2) is a permissionless staking module that plugs into Lido via the StakingRouter and lets node operators run Ethereum validators with stETH-denominated bond collateral instead of large upfront ETH. Bonds are defined by piecewise linear bond curves so marginal bond cost falls as operators add more keys. Onboarding can be through VettedGate (Merkle whitelist, lower bond) or PermissionlessGate (open, default bond). Most protocol parameters (penalties, deposit queue config, and strikes thresholds) are tied to curveId rather than to a single global setting. Fee distribution and bad-performance enforcement use oracle-delivered Merkle trees: operators claim rewards and strikes are applied via verified proofs. Exits support EIP-7002 triggerable withdrawals for forced exits. The design keeps the protocol permissionless while giving operators scalable bonds, curve-based differentiation, and oracle-driven rewards and penalties.
